# I've joined the #100DaysOfCode Challenge

## Why?
This will give me some structure. I find coding/ learning fun, and this seems like a nice way to stay consistent. 

## What will I be doing?
- Courses, projects, tutorials, anything that makes me write some code.
- At least 1 leetcode question a day

## What happens after?
I'll be taking what I learn, along with the projects I've built, and looking for opportunities to apply these skills. 


## Where I'm at

I'm currently a full-time student looking to fast-track my career and explore my options. I recently made my first project, a website, which I enjoyed the whole proccess of so much, it inspired me to do more.

**Goals**:
- Explore popular technologies and terms
- Get comfortable setting up, working on, and finishing projects
- At least 1 leet code question a day
  - Do questions in python to learn it
- Review on-the-job and interview skills/ concepts.
  - Books/ videos + mock interviews/ related conversation
