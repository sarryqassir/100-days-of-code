# I've joined the #100DaysOfCode Challenge

## Why?
This will give me some structure. I find coding/ learning fun, and this seems like a nice way to stay consistent. 

## What happens after?
I'll be taking what I learn, along with the projects I've built, and looking for opportunities to apply these skills.
