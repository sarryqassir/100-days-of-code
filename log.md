# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Where I'm at

I'm going to school full time, but I want to futher my knowledge and practice programming. I started by making a personal website with react, which was my first personal project, and it taught me a lot about react, js, and I even learned typescript. The website isn't professional, since my focus was learning, and I'm looking to continue learning and trying things out before I start seriously applying to jobs. I've been trying to consume a lot of content and ask questions to learn more about what's out there, and it's helped a lot.

I started freeCodeCamp two days ago (January 21) mainly to test myself and rememeber the basic content I've learned in school that I'm likely rusty with. I finished the first section on HTML and CSS, but only did one of the projects, since I'm pretty comfortable with HTML and CSS, maybe I'll go back and do the others (probably not). I'm almost finished the [javascript algorithims and data structures](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/) course content, as expected, it's mostly stuff I already know from school.

I'm not too attached to this motivation grindset stuff, but having some structure is definately good and I'll be trying to stick with the challenge of coding at least an hour a day for the next 100 days, documenting my progress.

**Main Goal**: Start applying for jobs at the end of the 100 days regardless of where I'm at.

### Day 0: January 23, 2022, Sunday

**Today's Progress**:
Finished up [basic algorithim scripting](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/#basic-algorithm-scripting) and started on [OOP](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/#object-oriented-programming). I forgot to save any of my solutions and FCC doesn't save anything after submission, so no examples from there.

**Concepts**: Went over big O notation basics again, I'll be keeping it in mind in some of my solutions.

**Leet Code**: [Detect CapitalðŸŸ¢](https://leetcode.com/problems/detect-capital/) This problem was easy but took me a long time. Writing pseudo-code would have helped a lot, lesson learned. I will also be timing myself in the future.

### Day 1: January 24, 2022, Monday

**Leet Code**: [Roman to IntegerðŸŸ¢](https://leetcode.com/problems/roman-to-integer/) Time: ~40 Minutes | Language: JS | I used an object with the roman numerals as keys and their respective numeric values as values. I split the string and iterated through it, subtracting from the total if the previous value < the next value, and adding otherwise.

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
